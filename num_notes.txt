DRAW MATRIX

As the rect gets drawn, it is added a value.

   DRAW RECT

   Every rect is drawn separately.
   It's position is changed accordingly.
   The position together with the value of the rect is stored in a dictionary.
   The value is either a digit or ---nothing---.

   RANDOM VALUE

   Every rect either has value or it is empty inside. (RANDOM)
   The value is picked from an "array" of digits,
       that before each game is randomized.

CLICK

Each click is counted.

IF click != value_of_rect:    end_game()

   VALUE OF RECT

   Mouse clicks on position (x,y).
   Check if this pos in the dictionary has equal value as the clicks counter.

   	 POSITION OF MOUSE

	 Convert the pos into a value that is stored as a key in the dictionary.
